Creates, updates, deletes, gets or lists a <code>messages</code> resource.

## Overview
<table><tbody>

<tr><td><b>Type</b></td><td>Resource</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Id</b></td><td><CopyableCode code="aws.sqs.messages" /></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Fields

The following fields are returned by `SELECT` queries:

`SELECT` not supported for this resource, use `SHOW METHODS` to view available operations for the resource.


## Methods

The following methods are available for this resource:

<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Accessible by</th>
    <th>Required Params</th>
    <th>Optional Params</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td><a href="#delete_message"><CopyableCode code="delete_message" /></a></td>
    <td><CopyableCode code="delete" /></td>
    <td><a href="#parameter-region"><code>region</code></a></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message to delete, use the ReceiptHandle of the message (not the MessageId which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue. Each time you receive a message, meaning when a consumer retrieves a message from the queue, it comes with a unique ReceiptHandle. If you receive the same message more than once, you will get a different ReceiptHandle each time. When you want to delete a message using the DeleteMessage action, you must use the ReceiptHandle from the most recent time you received the message. If you use an old ReceiptHandle, the request will succeed, but the message might not be deleted. For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.</td>

## Parameters

Parameters can be passed in the `WHERE` clause of a query. Check the [Methods](#methods) section to see which parameters are required or optional for each operation.
