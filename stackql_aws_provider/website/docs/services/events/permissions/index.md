## Methods

The following methods are available for this resource:

<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Accessible by</th>
    <th>Required Params</th>
    <th>Optional Params</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td><a href="#remove_permission"><CopyableCode code="remove_permission" /></a></td>
    <td><CopyableCode code="update" /></td>
    <td><a href="#parameter-region"><code>region</code></a></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Revokes the permission of another Amazon Web Services account to be able to put events to the specified event bus. Specify the account to revoke by the StatementId value that you associated with the account when you granted it permission with PutPermission. You can find the StatementId by using DescribeEventBus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><a href="#put_permission"><CopyableCode code="put_permission" /></a></td>
    <td><CopyableCode code="replace" /></td>
    <td><a href="#parameter-region"><code>region</code></a></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Running PutPermission permits the specified Amazon Web Services account or Amazon Web Services organization to put events to the specified event bus. Amazon EventBridge rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to an event bus in your account. For another account to send events to your account, that external account must have an EventBridge rule with your account's event bus as a target. To enable multiple Amazon Web Services accounts to put events to your event bus, run PutPermission once for each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts are members of the same Amazon Web Services organization, you can run PutPermission once specifying Principal as "*" and specifying the Amazon Web Services organization ID in Condition, to grant permissions to all accounts in that organization. If you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions when they use PutTarget to add your account's event bus as a target. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. The permission policy on the event bus cannot exceed 10 KB in size.</td>
