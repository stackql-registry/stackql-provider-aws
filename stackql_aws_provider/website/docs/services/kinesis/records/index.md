    <td>Gets data records from a Kinesis data stream's shard. When invoking this API, you must use either the StreamARN or the StreamName parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the StreamARN input parameter when you invoke this API. Specify a shard iterator using the ShardIterator parameter. The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, GetRecords returns an empty list. It might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records. You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service limits (for more information, see Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call GetRecords in a loop. Use GetShardIterator to get the shard iterator to specify in the first GetRecords call. GetRecords returns a new shard iterator in NextShardIterator. Specify the shard iterator returned in NextShardIterator in subsequent calls to GetRecords. If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and GetRecords returns null in NextShardIterator. You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record to process. Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or throughput by using the Limit parameter to specify the maximum number of records that GetRecords can return. Consider your average record size when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call is 10,000. The size of the data returned by GetRecords varies depending on the utilization of the shard. It is recommended that consumer applications retrieve records via the GetRecords command using the 5 TPS limit to remain caught up. Retrieving records less frequently can lead to consumer applications falling behind. The maximum size of data that GetRecords can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next 1 second throw ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. GetRecords doesn't return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to GetRecords. However, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second. To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the MillisBehindLatest response attribute. You can also monitor the stream using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see Monitoring in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide). Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, ApproximateArrivalTimestamp, that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for example with PutRecords). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order. This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per shard.</td>

    <td>Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Call PutRecord to send data into the stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing, one record at a time. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 10 MiB per second. When invoking this API, you must use either the StreamARN or the StreamName parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the StreamARN input parameter when you invoke this API. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using the ExplicitHashKey parameter. For more information, see Adding Data to a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. PutRecord returns the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record. Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. To guarantee strictly increasing ordering, write serially to a shard and use the SequenceNumberForOrdering parameter. For more information, see Adding Data to a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. If a PutRecord request cannot be processed because of insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in the request, PutRecord throws ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can use IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod or DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod to modify this retention period.</td>

    <td>Writes multiple data records into a Kinesis data stream in a single call (also referred to as a PutRecords request). Use this operation to send data into the stream for data ingestion and processing. When invoking this API, you must use either the StreamARN or the StreamName parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the StreamARN input parameter when you invoke this API. Each PutRecords request can support up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 10 MiB, up to a limit of 10 MiB for the entire request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB per second. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; and an array of request Records, with each record in the array requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size limit applies to the total size of the partition key and data blob. The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information, see Adding Data to a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. Each record in the Records array may include an optional parameter, ExplicitHashKey, which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer to determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For more information, see Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. The PutRecords response includes an array of response Records. Each record in the response array directly correlates with a record in the request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and response. The response Records array always includes the same number of records as the request array. The response Records array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records in each PutRecords request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. As a result, PutRecords doesn't guarantee the ordering of records. If you need to read records in the same order they are written to the stream, use PutRecord instead of PutRecords, and write to the same shard. A successfully processed record includes ShardId and SequenceNumber values. The ShardId parameter identifies the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The SequenceNumber parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the stream. An unsuccessfully processed record includes ErrorCode and ErrorMessage values. ErrorCode reflects the type of error and can be one of the following values: ProvisionedThroughputExceededException or InternalFailure. ErrorMessage provides more detailed information about the ProvisionedThroughputExceededException exception including the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled. For more information about partially successful responses, see Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can use IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod or DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod to modify this retention period.</td>
